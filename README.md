I'm William Stafford Parsons, a long-time software engineer turned computer science researcher and [minimalist game developer](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#games).

I create minimalist video games that are fun to play for a few minutes at a time with high-quality, smooth gameplay for modern desktop web browsers using pure CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

- [Contrivity](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/contrivity) An endless twin-stick shooting game with randomized weapons

Furthermore, I have an uncommon affinity for denying impossibility, noticing patterns, approaching common problems unconventionally and applying simplicity.

As a responsibility, I conduct [open computer science research](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#research) in the area of creating improved fundamental algorithms and data structures.

The following results from my independent, unfunded research are capable of setting timeless software engineering standards in popular programming languages for energy-efficient, high-performance, practical computing when applied to systems such as databases, internet network infrastructure and web browser JavaScript engines.

- [WSP-Hash-256](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-256): An improvement to SHA-256 and a cryptanalysis test subject
- [WSP-Hash-32](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-32): The fastest portable 32-bit hashing algorithm with good quality 
- [WSP-Hash-64](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-64): The fastest portable 64-bit hashing algorithm with good quality
- [WSP-Hash-OAAT](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-oaat): The fastest OAAT hashing algorithm with good quality
- [WSP-Navigate](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-navigate): An optimal 2D grid step navigation calculation algorithm
- [WSP-PRNG-16](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-prng-16): The fastest 16-bit PRNG with good quality
- [WSP-PRNG-32](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-prng-32): The fastest one-at-a-time 32-bit PRNG with good quality
- [WSP-Search-Sorted](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-search-sorted): The fastest search algorithm derived from Binary Search
- [WSP-Sort-Unstable](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-sort-unstable): The fastest in-place sorting algorithm without auxiliary space
- [WSP-TRNG](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-trng): A TRNG with quantum-level entropy generated internally
- [WSP-Vortex](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-vortex): A Mersenne Twister improvement faster than Xorshift32

I'm currently working on a new hash table with optimal insertion, lookup and resizing schemes while contributing the aforementioned results across popular open-source repositories.
