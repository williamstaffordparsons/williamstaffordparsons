I'm William Stafford Parsons, a long-time software engineer turned computer science researcher and minimalist game developer.

I create [minimalist video games](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#games) that are fun to play for a few minutes at a time with high-quality, smooth gameplay for modern desktop web browsers using pure CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

I conduct [open computer science research](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#research) in the area of creating improved fundamental algorithms and data structures.

- [WSP-Vortex](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-vortex) &nbsp; A Mersenne Twister improvement faster than Xorshift32

I'm currently working on video game creation and a new hash table with optimal insertion, lookup and resizing schemes.

Furthermore, I'm working on contributing the aforementioned research results to popular open-source repositories for money.
