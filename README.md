I'm a computer science researcher, entrepreneur, game developer and web software engineer.

I create [tiny offline browser games](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#games) that are fun to play for a few minutes at a time.

- [Contrivity](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/contrivity) is an endless twin-stick shooting game.

I conduct [open computer science research](https://williamstaffordparsons.github.io/#research) resulting in improved fundamental algorithms and data structures.

- [WSP-Hash-256](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-256) is an improvement to SHA-256 and a cryptanalysis test subject.
- [WSP-Hash-32](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-32) is the fastest portable 32-bit hashing algorithm with good quality.
- [WSP-Hash-64](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-64) is the fastest portable 64-bit hashing algorithm with good quality.
- [WSP-Hash-OAAT](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-hash-oaat) is the fastest OAAT hashing algorithm with good quality.
- [WSP-Navigate](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-navigate) is an optimal 2D grid step navigation calculation algorithm.
- [WSP-PRNG-16](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-prng-16) is the fastest 16-bit PRNG with good quality.
- [WSP-PRNG-32](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-prng-32) is the fastest one-at-a-time 32-bit PRNG with good quality.
- [WSP-Search-Sorted](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-search-sorted) is the fastest search algorithm derived from Binary Search.
- [WSP-Sort-Unstable](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-sort-unstable) is the fastest in-place sorting algorithm without auxiliary space.
- [WSP-TRNG](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-trng) is a TRNG with quantum-level entropy generated internally.
- [WSP-Vortex](https://github.com/williamstaffordparsons/wsp-vortex) is a Mersenne Twister improvement faster than Xorshift32.
